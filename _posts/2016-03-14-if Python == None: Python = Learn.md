# Python

I have embarked on a journey of learning Python and HTML/CSS. Before I get into more details, I would like to take a moment and apologize if the title of my post was confusing. It was an **attempt** at mimicking the coding language of Python. If you understood the title, CONGRATS YOU’RE A NERD!

Let me start with a brief background on Python. Python is an open source programming language that was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum.It was made to look good and also be easy to read.

I am taking a beginner’s course in Python on Coursera. It is taught by Dr. Chuck at the University of Michigan. I am in the last week of the beginner’s course, and after that, I will take additional courses taught by Dr. Chuck to supplement this one.

As someone who is interested in computer engineering, I believe that it is important to introduce myself to various programming languages. I have chosen to start with Python and will continue to explore other languages as well.
