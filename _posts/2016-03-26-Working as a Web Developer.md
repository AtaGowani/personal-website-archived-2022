# I’m a Web Developer!

About a week ago, I had a chance to visit my dad at his new company, Gowani Pump Supply. I spent the whole day there, mainly just sitting around, as there was nothing for me to do.

After I got home, I thought about his new business and realized that I could help him reach a wider audience by getting Gowani Pump Supply a presence on the glorious internet.

I shared this idea with him, and he agreed! However, while I am not an experienced web developer, I dived into it, hoping to learn more as time went on.

Step one would have been to make a functional website before hosting it online. Although I was aware of this crucial step, I skipped it. I was too excited to own a domain name and hoped that having a running website domain would motivate me to work faster on building the website. Once I had purchased a domain and had a domain hosting site, I went on to create a temporary page that provided the viewer with basic information such as the name of the company and contact information. I ended it with “Website Under Construction” so that I could update it as I further developed my skills.
